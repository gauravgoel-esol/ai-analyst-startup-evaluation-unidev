            "text": "Pricing Strategy - Separate sheet attached\n* Rationale behind pricing - Straight feature pricing, considering our costs and margins, future\nexpansion costs, enterprise ROIs, existing competitors pricing, and discounts.\nUnit Economics\n* Key metrics for revenue generation.\n* Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): These metrics are not clearly defined currently\nas we are in the early traction and growth stage. Current spends on sales is about INR\n4 lakhs per month. With this we have generated about $400,000 of booked revenues.\n* Lifetime Value (LTV): Upwards of $1 million minimum as enterprise stickiness is\nsimply routed in customer service and usage simplicity. It doesnt depend on ad-spend\non any other extremely volatile, money grubbing, high-risk spends and factors.\n* LTV: CAC Ratio: A minimum of 10 which will grow further with increase in the\nnumber of subscriptions. A PAT of minimum 30%.\nRecurring vs. One-Time Revenue\n* Segregate revenue into:\n* Recurring Revenue: Subscription fees, AMC costs, Marketplace subscriptions\n* One-Time Revenue: Set up costs\nPayment Flow and Terms\n* How payments are collected and processed.\n* Payments are collected from the enterprise directly.\n* Payment frequency - It may be monthly or annual depending on the enterprise.\nDiscounts will be provided for annual advance payments.\n* Refund and cancellation policies: No refund, upon cancelling subscription, the client\nwill be billed for the current month and then the subscription will be cancelled.\nScalability of Revenue Model\n* The development costs are fixed and will increase in a linear manner. As the number of\nsubscriptions grow, the revenues will grow exponentially.\n* As we are primarily deploying our solution on the client environment, we have no dynamic\ncosts. The costs of cloud computing, infrastructure, and hyperscaler is borne by the customer,\ngiving us higher margins and lower volatilityy/variable costs.\n* Assumptions for scalability of revenue model: Majority of customers choosing\ndeployment of solution on their own premises/cloud environment.\nAdditional Revenue Opportunities\n* Consultation for AI adoption"
