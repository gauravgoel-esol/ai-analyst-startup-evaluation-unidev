Here is the definitive, fact-grounded\nnarrative with powerful report-based validation.\nWhy InLustro/Syntras Technology Stack is the Only True Solution for Workforce Readiness in\n2025\n1. The Workforce Readiness Crisis: Education and Training Systems are Fundamentally Broken\n* Over half of recent graduates feel unprepared for the workplace, with 52% doubting their\neducation will secure a job within 12 months (Wheebox India Skills Report 2025). Employers\necho this: hiring managers report that traditional credentials no longer predict job success\n(NACE Job Outlook 2025).\n* Globally, skill demand shifts appear at an unprecedented pace. By 2030, 39% of core\nworkforce skills will change or become obsolete (World Economic Forum, Future of Jobs\nReport 2025). This requires continuous, adaptable, and scalable learning platforms --\ntraditional static curricula cannot keep pace.\n* Labor force participation rates in key markets remain below pre-pandemic levels; tight labor\nmarkets make every day of onboarding inefficiency costly to companies (U.S. Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, June 2025).\n2. Corporate Training is Astronomically Expensive Yet Ineffective Without AI-Driven\nSimulation\n* Worldwide corporate training spend tops $400B annually, yet average ramp-up times linger\naround 3-6 months, wasting billions in lost productivity (LinkedIn Workplace Learning\nReport 2025)."

Meanwhile,\ncompanies spend months and significant resources onboarding fresh talent who still struggle\nto perform.\n* Business Model - InLustro operates on a B2B and B2B2C model, delivering high-impact,\nsimulation-based learning and hiring solutions to academic institutions and corporates. Our\nprimary revenue comes from institutional contracts where we design and deliver experiential\ntraining programs to bridge the employability gap. With the launch of our product Syntra, our\njob simulation platform, we will be transitioning toward a scalable SaaS model offering tiered\nand pay-per-use pricing to institutions and corporates. Our business combines high-touch\nservice delivery with high-scale product adoption to drive recurring, high-margin revenue.\nPipeline\n* Sales Pipeline Value\n* As of July 2025, InLustros qualified sales pipeline stands at INR 4.8 Cr+, spanning\nongoing conversations with over 30 new academic institutions and 10 new corporate\nclients across India. These prospects are in various stages of the conversion funnel -\nranging from pilot discussions to proposal negotiations and MoU finalization. This\npipeline includes institutional engagements for our experiential learning services and\nearly interest in Syntras deployment for hiring, onboarding, and training use cases.\nOur structured outreach and account-based approach have ensured high-intent leads,\nwith an average deal value of INR 12 to 15 lakhs for academic engagements and\npotentially INR 8 to 20 lakhs for corporate contracts.\n* Projected Growth Opportunities\n* With the new NEP-aligned emphasis on employability and skill-based credits, colleges are\nactively seeking partners like InLustro to bridge the industry-readiness gap. We aim to expand\nfrom our current footprint of 45+ institutions to 100+ partner colleges over the next 12-15\nmonths, supported by Syntras tiered product offerings and bundled services.\n* As organizations push for efficient fresher onboarding and continuous upskilling, Syntra is\npositioned as a strategic solution for Hire-Train-Deploy models, &D programs, and\nAI-based candidate evaluation. We plan to grow this vertical through multi-year corporate\nengagements and expand into BFSI, IT Services, and Manufacturing."

Companies are actively replacing\nmanual assessments and training with automation and AI-powered tools.\n* The NEP 2020 and UGC guidelines now emphasize experiential learning and\nindustry alignment, pushing colleges to partner with innovative platforms.\n* Companies are increasingly shifting to Hire-Train-Deploy models, seeking partners\nwho can both evaluate and prepare talent for specific job roles, at scale.\n* CSR funding is moving toward employability, digital skilling, and tier-2/tier-3\noutreach, opening new avenues for sustainable impact-driven programs.\n* Competitive Edge\n* Syntra is the only experiential JobTech platform that combines AI-based job\nsimulations, custom role evaluators, and &D tools into a single platform.\n* Unlike content-only or assessment-only competitors, InLustros approach is hands-on,\ncontextual, and outcome-driven, with live projects, simulation-based learning, and\nhiring integration.\n* Our platform is built for both campuses and corporates, allowing us to serve the full\neducation-to-employment pipeline and create high stickiness across stakeholders.\n* Urgency/Opportunity\n* Institutions need scalable, NEP-compliant skilling partners to retain relevance and\nboost placement outcomes, even more so when the employability gap is widening and\nstudents are far behind industry requirements.\n* Corporates are looking to cut hiring costs, reduce onboarding timelines, and evaluate\ncandidates through real-work scenarios, with anti-cheating protocol and plagiarism\ncheckers / AI-detection protocol.\n* We are at the cusp of a major shift in how early talent is trained and hired. InLustro,\nthrough Syntra, is positioned to become the infrastructure layer for future-ready talent\npipelines, delivering both capability and credibility at scale.\nFinancials\n* Funding Ask - INR 2.5 Crores\n* Structure (e.g., SAFE, Convertible Note) - We are raising our Seed round through a SAFE\ninstrument, with a valuation cap and discount structure designed to align long-term interests\nwith our early backers.
