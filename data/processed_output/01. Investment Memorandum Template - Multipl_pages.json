This a valuation (~15.4 Million USD)\ncontinuation of the same and we are looking to\nraise another USD1.2mn to USD1.5mn\nProposed Investment: Rs2.5 Crore Ownership Sought: Estimated ~1.80% (based on Rs2.5\nCr investment at a ~Rs137 Cr pre-money valuation)\nKey Recommendation: Invest in a category-defining wealthtech platform pioneering Spendvesting,\nwhich connects Indias $900Bn+ mutual fund market with its $2.1Tn+ consumption economy, delivering\nsuperior returns for consumers while unlocking new loyalty and payment rails for brands.\nMultipl is reimagining mutual funds for Indias Zillennial consumers by merging market-linked investing\nwith aspirational spending. The platform allows users to invest towards planned and unplanned purchases\n(travel, weddings, gadgets, insurance premiums), and upon redemption, combine mutual fund returns with\nbrand-funded discounts, effectively generating ~20% IRRs versus ~8-9% from traditional savings\nproducts\nSince inception, Multipl has scaled to 700K+ registered users, 200K+ KYC-verified accounts, 100K+\nactive goals, and Rs100+ Cr AUA, with Rs600 Cr+ in target goals set. Cohort data shows ~80% goal\ncompletion and ~50% repeat goal creation by this cohort. With revenue margins of 5-5.5%, Multipl\nsignificantly outperforms traditional wealthtech peers (0.5-1.5%), driven by a dual-revenue model of\ninvestment commissions and brand commissions. The platform operates with a 20x LTV:CAC ratio (Rs9K\nvs. Rs450 CAC), showcasing capital efficiency and product-market fit.\nMultipls omnichannel distribution engine spans its consumer app, embedded partnerships with brands\n(MakeMyTrip, Samsung, Myntra, Ixigo) and financial platforms (FundsIndia), creating defensibility\nthrough integration lock-ins and switching costs. Consumer adoption is growing across metros and Tier 2/3\ncities, reinforcing the platforms broad relevance.\nFounded by repeat entrepreneurs Paddy and Jags Raghavan (previously scaled and exited Compute.io to\nCisco) and Vikas Jain (ex-Goldman, CFA, SEBI RIA), Multipl combines fintech, product, and capital\nmarkets expertise with proven execution experience. The company is raising a new round to accelerate\ngrowth, embed with more brand and financial partners, and enhance its product stack (instant redemption,\ncredit integration, and co-branded solutions).\nThis investment offers exposure to a category-creating fintech at the intersection of wealth and\nconsumption, with strong early traction, robust unit economics, and the potential to become Indias leading\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LVX"

The company is\npioneering Spendvesting - enabling consumers to invest in mutual funds towards future purchases and\nearn brand-funded discounts on redemption, thereby transforming both personal finance and consumer\npayments.\nUnlike traditional wealthtech platforms focused solely on long-term investments, Multipl positions itself as\na new-age mutual fund account tailored to Zillennials and Millennials. It integrates seamlessly with\nleading asset management companies (ICICI, HDFC, etc.) while partnering with top brands (MakeMyTrip,\nMyntra, Samsung, Decathlon) to deliver dual value - investment returns + brand incentives.\nThe platform offers users a mix of planned goals (travel, weddings, insurance premiums, big-ticket retail)\nand unplanned spends (shopping funds, instant purchases), ensuring high relevance without demanding\nbehavioral change. Its proprietary robo-advisory engine dynamically allocates across 1,400+ mutual funds\nbased on risk profiling, duration, and financial personality, while account aggregator integration enables\nholistic financial planning.\nTEAM\nMultipl is led by a complementary founding trio with deep expertise across technology, fintech, and\ncapital markets:\n* Paddy Raghavan (Co-Founder & CEO) - 3x founder with over a decade in the startup\necosystem.
