            "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCompany Name: Nithiravya Private Limited Stage: Pre-Seed\nHeadquarters: Bangalore (Operational in Delhi Founding Year: 2021\n& Mumbai)\nAmount Raising: Rs2.5 Crore Pre-money valuation: Rs13.5 Cr pre-money valuation\nProposed Investment: Rs1.5 Crore Ownership Sought: Estimated: ~9.4% (based on Rs1.5\nCr at Rs16 Cr post-money valuation)\nKey Recommendation: Ziniosa represents a compelling investment opportunity at the intersection of three\npopular tailwinds: (1) the rapid digitization of Indias luxury consumption, (2) the global acceleration of\nrecommerce, and (3) rising demand for authenticated, accessibly priced fashion among Indias urban\nmillennials and Gen Z consumers.\nThe company has achieved early category leadership in the pre-loved luxury segment through strong\nexecution, clear positioning, and trust-driven partnerships. It is the only authenticated resale partner on Tata\nCliq Luxury, a channel that provides both demand validation and long-term brand advantage. With a zero-\ninventory acquisition cost model, Ziniosa has scaled GMV to Rs4.2 Cr in FY24 (from Rs3 Cr in FY23) with\n~Rs40-45L monthly run rate, an 80% sell-through rate, and minimal burn, rare metrics in early-stage fashion\ncommerce.\nThe platform hosts 7,000+ SKUs across handbags, sunglasses, belts, and shoes, and has fulfilled 5,000+\norders with a CAC of Rs900 and AOV of Rs20,000. Ziniosa operates asset-light with inventory held on\nconsignment for 90 days and an authentication-first protocol that includes counterfeit penalties and tech\npartnerships. Their inventory base exceeds Rs15 Cr -- all acquired at zero cost, and fully under Ziniosas\npricing and sales control.\nThe team has maintained CM1 and CM2 profitability, unusual for a consumer platform at this stage. The\n38% repeat rate, ~6,000 unique buyers, and growing brand presence (90K Instagram followers; 5M monthly\nviews) suggest emerging customer stickiness. International expansion (via B2B partnerships in Japan/UAE\nand listing on eBay) and the upcoming physical store launch offer credible paths to scale inventory and\ndeepen distribution.\nThe current raise of Rs2.5 Cr, led by Inflection Point Ventures, values the business at Rs13.5 Cr pre-money.\nWith Rs1 Cr already committed (40% of round), we recommend participation of Rs1.5 Cr, which would secure\na meaningful ~9.4% stake in a differentiated, category-defining business.\nZiniosa is not a generic resale marketplace -- it is a brand-first, trust-centric commerce engine solving deep\ninefficiencies in access, price transparency, and counterfeits in Indias luxury ecosystem. This is a high-\nconviction bet on the formalization of aspirational commerce, backed by efficient execution and proven\nearly traction.\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LetsVenture"

While global brands double down on their India expansion plans, the average consumer faces a\ndisconnected, exclusionary experience marked by:\nThe Consumer Reality\n* Pricing walls: Luxury handbags, belts, and sunglasses typically retail at Rs30,000 to Rs2,00,000, well\nbeyond reach for aspirational buyers.\n* Distrust: Over 25-30% of luxury items sold in India are counterfeit, especially in secondary\nmarkets, severely limiting resale trust.\n* Limited access: India has only five premium malls catering to luxury shoppers. Tier 2-3 cities are\nalmost entirely excluded from physical luxury retail.\n* Lack of verified resale options: Online marketplaces and Instagram sellers dominate the second-\nhand space, but offer zero authentication, no customer protection, and inconsistent pricing.\nThis isnt just a friction point, its a structurally broken category in a Rs82,000 Cr market, underserved by\ntech, trust, and credible brands.\nThe Category Problem\nSecond-hand luxury fashion is a $10B+ global opportunity, but remains completely unorganized in India.\nThe few platforms that exist operate as informal resellers, with no standard for pricing, packaging, trust, or\npost-sale support.\nCurrent Alternatives\n* Instagram/WhatsApp Resellers: The dominant format today but with no standards, no support,\nand high buyer risk.\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LetsVenture\nAshri Jaiswal 50.0% Varun Ramani"

With the market expected to cross Rs82,000 Cr, and premium brands\nexpanding offline and online, a new generation of aspirational consumers is actively seeking affordable,\nverified access to luxury, not just exclusivity. Yet, second-hand luxury remains broken: informal,\ncounterfeit-ridden, and invisible outside of metros. Ziniosa is entering at the right inflection point, where\ndemand for trust, access, and affordability intersects with a digital-native customer base and a growing\nsupply of idle luxury inventory.\nAs global resale platforms like The RealReal, Vestiaire Collective, and Rebag prove the profitability of\nauthenticated luxury recommerce, India is at the very beginning of that curve, with no scaled, brand-trusted\nplayer. Ziniosa is solving not just for resale, but for verified entry into luxury, at a time when the market is\ncraving both value and legitimacy.\nWhats Different Today:\n* INR 82,000 Cr luxury market in India -- growing 3x faster than mass apparel, with deep demand\nbeyond metro cities.\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LetsVenture\n$350 B $3 B\nGLOBAL SECONDHAND MARKET BY 2027 SECONDHAND FASHION MARKET IN INDIA\nOUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE A\nTOTAL OF APPROX 40,00,000 LUXURY\nFASHION ITEMS AND APPROX 20,00,0 | | |\nAFFORDABLE LUXURY ITEMS IN DELHI ALONE.\nINDIAN FASHION MARKET INDIAN LUXURY SECTOR BY 2030"

Verified resale is how young India\nwants to enter the luxury market smartly, not silently.\nSOLUTION\nZiniosa is Indias first full-stack platform for authenticated luxury resale, enabling both buyers and sellers\nto transact with confidence, speed, and transparency. Operating on a 90-day exclusive consignment model,\nZiniosa authenticates every item using a 15+ point checklist, backed by global verification tools and tech-\nenabled protocols. Products are shipped to Ziniosas facility, professionally inspected, cleaned (if needed),\nphotographed, and listed. Sellers receive payouts only post-sale, creating an inventory-rich but asset-light\nmodel with zero upfront procurement cost.\nWith a focus on handbags, belts, sunglasses, and fashion accessories, Ziniosa curates SKU drops that are\ndata-backed, seasonally relevant, and price-disciplined. Its 80%+ sell-through rate is driven by a proprietary\npricing engine that benchmarks real-time resale values across categories and brands. Listings are live for\n90 days; unsold items are returned free of cost, eliminating friction for sellers and maintaining inventory\nfreshness.\nZiniosa also partners with Tata Cliq Luxury, powering its pre-loved category for handbags and belts --\nmaking it the only Indian resale brand with a presence on a premium marketplace. This distribution edge\nsupports both trust and top-funnel discovery.\nKey Product Features & Value Props:\n* Zero Inventory Acquisition Cost: Rs15 Cr+ worth of active inventory held without upfront capex,\nenabled by consignment-led inbound logistics.\n* Authentication Protocol: All items go through a verified process using international tech\nplatforms; failed products are charged a Rs5,000 counterfeit penalty -- which acts as both deterrent\nand margin stream.\n* Warehouse-Led Quality Control: Every product is cleaned, inspected, photographed, and\ndispatched by Ziniosas in-house team, ensuring brand consistency and packaging quality.\n* Dynamic Pricing Engine: Listing prices are recommended using brand/category/seasonal demand\ninputs, optimizing for fast sell-through and fair value.\n* Full-Stack Experience: From seller onboarding to buyer delivery, Ziniosa manages logistics,\npayments, authentication, and customer support.\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LetsVenture"

The company is building distribution through trust-\naligned formats, not just channels -- with unit economics and brand equity improving as the network\ndeepens.\nEarly Win:\nZiniosa is the only pre-loved brand in India selected by Tata Cliq Luxury to power its authenticated\nresale category for handbags and belts.\n* Indias first and only resale partner listed on Tata Cliq Luxury\n* Live in the handbags and belts categories alongside Gucci, Coach, Michael Kors\n* Provides zero-CAC access to premium buyers and unmatched category trust\n* Signals strong platform endorsement in a market where resale lacks institutional support\n* Creates a barrier to entry for competitors; no other player has this level of integration\nDEAL DETAILS\nTransaction Overview\nZiniosa is raising a Rs2.5 Cr Pre-Seed round via Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS),\nwith a pre-money valuation of Rs13.5 Cr.

Allocation is time-sensitive. Commitments are\nfinal once confirmed. Call for capital will be initiated immediately post-commitment.\nRISKS & MITIGATIONS\nCounterfeit Risk:\n* Risk: As 30%+ of luxury goods in India are counterfeit, resale transactions can be fraught with\ntrust issues. The platforms integrity relies on its ability to filter fakes.\n* Mitigation: Ziniosa uses a 15+ point authentication protocol backed by global tech partners and\nin-house QA. Sellers agree upfront to a Rs5,000 counterfeit penalty, which acts as both deterrent and\nmonetization lever.\nSupply Scale vs. Quality:\n* Risk: Scaling consignment inventory may attract inconsistent or lower-quality SKUs, diluting trust\nand increasing processing overhead.\n* Mitigation: The company curates listings with brand/condition filters and retains the right to reject\nSKUs that dont meet resale criteria. 90-day consignment limits reduce listing bloat and keep SKU\nvelocity high.\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LetsVenture"

            "text": "Operational Bandwidth:\n* Risk: As volume grows, centralized authentication, photography, and packaging could strain\noperations or slow down onboarding.\n* Mitigation: Ziniosa has built lean but modular backend processes with a centralized facility, and\nplans to invest in automation (e.g., instant pricing tools, inventory prioritization) as scale increases.\nConsumer Education & Category Creation:\n* Risk: Luxury resale is still new to Indian consumers. A lack of awareness or stigma around pre-\nowned could limit adoption outside metro cities.\n* Mitigation: Strong content-driven GTM (5M+ Instagram views/month), trust anchors like Tata\nCliq Luxury, and physical pop-ups have helped validate the category. Repeat rate of 38% signals\npositive buyer sentiment.\nTalent & Execution Risk:\n* Risk: Limited headcount could become a constraint as the business expands categories, markets,\nand channels simultaneously.\n* Mitigation: Founders have prior ops/e-comm experience and have executed lean scale so far. Plans\ninclude targeted hiring across authentication, category management, and cross-border operations\nin FY26.\nEXIT POTENTIALS\nZiniosa is building an infrastructure-grade asset in a category thats trending global and formalizing fast.\nIts margin profile, control over supply and experience, and integration with premium retail (e.g., Tata Cliq\nLuxury) position it as an acquisition-ready business -- not just a brand.\nCredible Exit Pathways:\nStrategic Sale to Luxury or Premium Retail Platforms Ziniosa gives large ecommerce players a turnkey\nresale engine -- authentication, pricing, fulfilment, trust. Potential acquirers:\n* Tata Cliq / Infiniti Retail (Tata Group) - existing partner\n* Reliance Retail (AJIO Luxe) - building luxury verticals\n* Nykaa Fashion - moving into premium designer resale\n* Aditya Birla (TMRW) - acquiring D2C infrastructure for The Collective, House of Brands\nWhy Ziniosa fits: Plug-and-play resale capability, existing luxury catalog, proven sell-through engine,\noperational control.\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LetsVenture"

            "text": "INVESTMENT THESIS\nZiniosa represents a rare combination of category timing, operational discipline, and founder-market fit --\nbuilding trust-first infrastructure in a market where luxury is booming, but resale is broken.\nIn a space crowded by informal Instagram sellers and underwhelming marketplace experiences, Ziniosa has\ntaken the harder path: full-stack authentication, SKU-level curation, and capital-light consignment at\nmeaningful scale. The result is a business that doesnt just chase GMV -- it controls the transaction, the\nmargin, and the experience.\nWe believe Ziniosa is a high-quality pre-seed opportunity with clear right-to-win in a whitespace that is 5-\n7 years behind global benchmarks -- and accelerating.\nWhy Were Investing:\nFounders Who Execute: Ashri and Varun have bootstrapped this business to Rs4.2 Cr in revenue with no\ninstitutional capital -- maintaining CM1 and CM2 positive, building trust at unit level, and showing\nresourceful control over ops and growth.\nA Market Begging for Structure: Indias Rs82,000 Cr luxury market is expanding fast, but resale remains\nunstructured, offline, and fraud-prone. With 30% of goods counterfeit and no scaled player, Ziniosa fills a\nclear gap with platform discipline and brand integrity.\nDefensible Advantage from Day 1: Tata Cliq Luxury validation, 80% sell-through rate, Rs15 Cr inventory\nheld at zero cost -- these are hard-to-replicate signals in an early-stage business. Theyre operating with\nsupply chain, pricing, and distribution moats already in place.\nExceptional Capital Efficiency: This is not a blitzscale and pray company. The model is lean, the CAC\nis low (Rs900), AOV is high (Rs20,000), and each transaction is profitable. Burn is controlled, team is lean,\nand cash deployment is tied to unlocks -- not vanity metrics.\nMultiple Exit Paths in a Formalizing Category: As luxury platforms, brand aggregators, and global\nresale players circle India, Ziniosa is positioned as both a strategic fit and an infrastructure partner -- not\njust a brand. This makes the exit optionality real, not aspirational.\nFinal Thoughts:\nZiniosa is not building a resale website -- its building a trusted layer for pre-loved luxury in India, where\ntrust is scarce, and demand is compounding. The opportunity is large, the execution is proven, and the\nupside is asymmetric.\nThis is a deal we want in early -- before scale dilutes access.\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LetsVenture"
