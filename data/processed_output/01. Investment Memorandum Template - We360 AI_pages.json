In a $2B global market where hybrid workforces are the norm but\nmanagement tools remain fragmented, We360.ai replaces manual oversight, disjointed time-\ntracking tools, and subjective performance assessments with a unified, AI-powered platform.\nMost enterprises still rely on disparate systems for monitoring productivity, tracking engagement,\nand managing employee capacity resulting in inefficiencies, blind spots, and attrition risks. As\nworkforce costs account for up to 80% of enterprise expenses, this legacy model breaks at scale.\nWe360.ai is designed to solve this providing plug-and-play software that turns workforce data into\nactionable insights on productivity, engagement, and operational efficiency.\nSince launching in 2021, We360.ai has scaled to 30,000+ paid users across 600+ enterprise\nclients, including leading IT/ITES, BFSI, and healthcare firms in India. With 96%+ retention, Rs7.2\nCr ARR, and 95% gross margins, the company has shown strong product-market fit and\ndisciplined, profitable growth achieved with zero external burn. With US ARPU trending at 2.5x\nIndian ARPU, the company is now entering international markets with a founder-led GTM\nstrategy.

Theres no single\nsource of truth.\n* High-cost, low-leverage execution: Agencies execute logistics, but marketers have\nlimited visibility, no automation, and zero repeatability.\n* Zero integration with sales systems: there is no structured CRM sync, conversion\ninsight, or lead quality tracking -- making follow-up a guessing game.\n* Events run like projects, not programs: Every event is a one-off effort theres no\ntemplatization, central ops layer, or way to scale with confidence.\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LetsVenture\nce Marat af peartinhat Development & 23 , 2x Founder 20+ Years in Insurance & Marketing\nSeater Berets tee & 1x Seen Exit\nTechnology & Product at We360.ai Marketing & Sales & We360.ai\nmavQ MTX Sewer tw | = ae Ez"

Most existing tools fall into\nthree categories:\n* Legacy HRMS & Attendance Systems (e.g., Keka): Built for HR compliance, not\nproductivity insights. These platforms manage payroll and attendance but lack analytics,\ncapacity planning, or engagement tracking.\n* Time-Tracking & Monitoring Tools (e.g., Time Doctor, ActivTrak): Focused on basic\ntracking or surveillance. Offer limited analytics, poor user experience, and no business\nintelligence integration.\n* DIY Internal Tools (Spreadsheets, Custom Dashboards): Often cobbled together by\nteams, these lack automation, real-time insights, or scalability leading to fragmented\nworkflows and decision-making bottlenecks.\nNone of these solutions treat workforce productivity as a strategic, data-driven function with\nproactive insights, AI-led recommendations, or direct business impact.\nCurrent Alternatives\nEnterprises today rely on a fragmented mix of legacy systems, point solutions, and manual\nworkarounds to manage workforce productivity. Each tool solves a narrow slice of the problem,\nbut none offer the integrated intelligence, scalability, or AI-driven insights that modern enterprises\nrequire.\n* Legacy HRMS & Attendance Systems (e.g., Keka, Zoho People):\nDesigned for payroll, compliance, and attendance -- not productivity. These systems offer\nlittle visibility into daily workflows, employee engagement, or capacity utilization.\n* Focused on administrative HR tasks, not operational efficiency\n* No real-time analytics or AI-led insights\n* Poor integration with business KPIs or productivity outcomes\n* Time-Tracking & Surveillance Tools (e.g., Time Doctor, ActivTrak, Teramind): Built\nprimarily for basic tracking or compliance monitoring, often with a surveillance mindset.\nConfidential - For Internal Use Only | LetsVenture"
